# Google-Books-Search

PURPOSE: 
This app is created to search for Google Books and save your favorite book.

OVERVIEW:
This is a Full Stack MERN app. We have used Node JS and Express for server side working and React for client side working. On server side we are connecting our Node app with React to pull Google Books from API and push it on the client side to display on screen. We have used MongoDB as a database to save the favorite books and delete them if not needed. For designing and layouts we have used Bootstrap. We have created different components for different pages using React.

HOW TO USE:
User will navigate to the app and will see the homepage where user can type any book name they wish to read and click search button. It will display all the relevant results. User can click the 'Go to Book' link to read the book and can also click save button to save book in database. Then we have a save page where user can view all the saved books.
